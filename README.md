# Overview
Matt Williamson's configuration files.

My config files have been created with this in mind...

* Start from scratch, learn the native functionality first.
* Never override native keybindings (my VIM mappings are all prefixed with the default `\` leader).
* Only add what I need and actually use.  Use as few plugins or customizations as necessary.

# Installation
Clone to home directory...
```
git clone git@github.com:mddubs/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
```

Then symlink the files you want to use...
```
ln -s ~/dotfiles/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
